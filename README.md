### Background

* Burger Tracker is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

* Whenever you submit a burger's name, your app will see the burger displayed on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

* Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger moves to the right side of the page.

* Your app stores every burger in the burger_DB database
